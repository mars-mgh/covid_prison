"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Counts are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year. Data for 2018 have been updated with changes to the population counts for several states. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Estimates for 2018 and 2019 include imputed counts for Oregon, which did not submit 2018 or 2019 National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) data. Estimates for 2019 also include imputed counts for Vermont, which provided total jurisdiction counts but could not break down the population by sentence length. See Methodology. Counts for 2018 and earlier may have been revised based on more recent reporting by states, and may differ from numbers in past reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
