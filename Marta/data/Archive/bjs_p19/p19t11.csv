"Note: Use caution when interpreting these statistics. Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on the prisoner’s self-report upon admission to prison. Some jurisdictions use a prisoner’s reported country of birth to determine current citizenship. BJS changed the way it measured citizenship for the 2016 reference year, requesting that National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) respondents include all non-U.S. citizens held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails and prisoners in the custody of other jurisdictions, with the exception of states with an integrated prison and jail system. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Data collected after 2015 should not be compared to data for previous years. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"a/Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on self-reports by prisoners at the time of admission. Some jurisdictions rely on law enforcement documents, court documents, or external validation to supplement the self-reporting data.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"c/U.S. and state totals for non-U.S. citizens by sex exclude Alabama, California, Maine, New Hampshire, and Oregon, which did not report citizenship counts by sex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"d/Prison population count is the sum of persons held in the custody of state and federally operated prisons and each jurisdiction’s private prison facilities. In 2019, the total custody population in publicly and privately operated state and federal correctional facilities was 1,339,961 (1,157,793 state and 174,391 federal), and the sentenced custody population in those same facilities was 1,292,978 (1,132,388 state and 160,590 federal). These counts exclude custody populations for Alaska and Rhode Island, which did not provide counts of non-U.S. citizens and whose numbers could not be imputed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"e/Total U.S. and state counts of non-U.S. citizen prisoners for 2019 include estimated counts for three states (California, New Hampshire, and Oregon) that did not report statistics on non-U.S. citizens. The 92.7% of prisoners who are not counted as non-U.S. citizens may not be U.S. citizens, as some may have an unknown citizenship status.",,,,,,,,,,,,
