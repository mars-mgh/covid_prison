"Note: In 2017, BJS began requesting that National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) respondents include all persons age 17 or younger held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails and in the custody of other jurisdictions. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Data collected after 2016 should not be compared to data for previous years. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",,,,
/Not reported.,,,,
