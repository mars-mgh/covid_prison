"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Counts and percentages are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional officials. Federal data include adult prisoners held in non-secure community-corrections facilities and adults and persons age 17 or younger held in privately operated facilities. Totals include imputed counts for Oregon, which did not submit 2019 National Prisoner Statistics data. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
